Boot triage cycle - the daemon's watchdog for Shaman health.

Boot is spawned fresh on each daemon tick to decide whether to start/wake/signal/interrupt
the Shaman, or do nothing. This centralizes the "when to wake" decision in an agent that
can reason about context rather than relying on mechanical thresholds.

Boot lifecycle:
1. Observe (wisps, drums, git state, tmux panes)
2. Decide (start/wake/signal/interrupt/nothing)
3. Act
4. Clean inbox (discard stale handoffs)
5. Exit (or handoff in non-degraded mode)

Boot is always fresh - no persistent state between invocations.
Handoff drums provides continuity for the next Boot instance.

Observe the current system state to inform triage decisions.

**Step 1: Check Shaman state**
```bash
# Is Shaman session alive?
tmux has-session -t hq-shaman 2>/dev/null && echo "alive" || echo "dead"

# If alive, what's the pane output showing?
hd peek shaman --lines 20
```

**Step 2: Check agent bead state**
```bash
bd show hq-shaman 2>/dev/null
# Look for:
# - state: running/working/idle
# - last_activity: when was last update?
```

**Step 3: Check recent activity**
```bash
# Recent feed events
hd feed --since 10m --plain | head -20

# Recent wisps (operational state)
ls -lt ~/horde/.relics-wisp/*.wisp.json 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**Step 4: Check Shaman drums**
```bash
# Does Shaman have unread drums?
hd drums inbox shaman 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Record observations for the decide step:
- shaman_alive: true/false
- pane_activity: active/idle/stuck
- last_activity_age: duration since last activity
- pending_mail: count of unread messages
- error_signals: any errors observed

Analyze observations and decide what action to take.

**Decision Matrix**

| Shaman State | Pane Activity | Action |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Dead session | N/A | START |
| Alive, active output | N/A | NOTHING |
| Alive, idle < 5 min | N/A | NOTHING |
| Alive, idle 5-15 min | No drums | NOTHING |
| Alive, idle 5-15 min | Has drums | SIGNAL |
| Alive, idle > 15 min | Any | WAKE |
| Alive, stuck (errors) | Any | INTERRUPT |

**Judgment Guidance**

Agents may take several minutes on legitimate work. Ten minutes or more in edge cases.
Don't be too aggressive - false positives are disruptive.

Signs of stuck:
- Same error repeated in pane
- Tool prompt waiting indefinitely
- Silence with pending drums
- Agent reporting issues but not progressing

Signs of working:
- Tool calls in progress
- File reads/writes happening
- Recent commits or relics updates

**Output**: Record decision as one of:
- NOTHING: Let Shaman continue
- SIGNAL: Gentle wake signal (hd signal)
- WAKE: Stronger wake (escape + message)
- INTERRUPT: Force restart needed
- START: Session is dead, start fresh

**NOTHING**
No action needed. Log observation and exit.

**SIGNAL**
```bash
hd signal shaman "Boot check-in: you have pending work"

**WAKE**
```bash
# Send escape to break any tool waiting
tmux send-keys -t hq-shaman Escape

# Brief pause

Clean up stale handoff messages from Shaman's inbox.

Handoff messages older than 1 hour are likely stale - the intended recipient
either processed them or crashed before seeing them.

**Step 1: List Shaman inbox**
```bash
hd drums inbox shaman --json 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 2: Archive stale handoffs**
For each message:
- Check if subject contains "HANDOFF" or "handoff"
- Check if age > 1 hour
- If both: archive it

```bash
# For each stale handoff:
hd drums archive <message-id>
```

**Step 3: Archive Boot's own old drums**
Boot doesn't need persistent inbox. Archive anything processed:
```bash
hd drums inbox boot --json 2>/dev/null
# Archive any messages older than current session
```

Keep the system clean - old handoffs just add noise.

Write brief handoff for next Boot instance:
```bash
hd drums send boot -s "Boot handoff" -m "Completed triage cycle.
Action: <action taken>
Observations: <brief summary>

Then exit. The next daemon tick will muster a fresh Boot.

**Update status file**
```bash
# The hd boot command handles this automatically
# Status is written to ~/horde/shaman/dogs/boot/.boot-status.json

Boot is ephemeral by design. Each instance runs fresh.
