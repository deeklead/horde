Find and reassign orphaned work.

Dogs work through totems (poured from this ritual) to scan for orphaned state:
- Issues marked in_progress with no active raider
- Totems attached but worker gone
- Merge queue entries with dead owners
- Wisps from terminated sessions

This is a cleanup and recovery ritual. Found orphans are either:
- Reassigned to available workers
- Reset to open status for next dispatch
- Escalated if data loss occurred

## Dog Contract

This is infrastructure work. You:
1. Receive scan scope via banner_bead (warband or encampment-wide)
2. Scan for orphaned state
3. Classify and triage orphans
4. Take recovery action
5. Report findings
6. Return to kennel

## Variables

| Variable | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| scope | banner_bead | Scan scope: 'encampment' or specific warband name |

## Why Dogs?

Orphan scanning requires multi-warband access and may need to interact with
multiple Witnesses. Dogs have the cross-warband worktrees needed for this."""

Establish what to scan for orphans.

**2. Resolve scope:**
- 'encampment': Scan all warbands
- '<warband>': Scan specific warband only

```bash
# If encampment-wide
hd warbands                     # Get list of all warbands

# If specific warband

Find issues marked in_progress with no active worker.

**2. For each in_progress issue, check assignee:**
```bash
bd show <issue-id>
# Get assignee field

**3. Check if assignee session exists:**
```bash
# If assignee is a raider
hd raiders <warband>           # Is the raider active?
tmux has-session -t <session> 2>/dev/null

**4. Identify orphans:**
- Issue in_progress + assignee session dead = orphan
